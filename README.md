# `#lang metamath` & a Racket-based Metamath IDE

This might grow into:

- A Racket-based parser for set.mm and other Metamath databases
- ...which reads the axioms and theorems into executable data structures that build only valid proofs 
- ...with interactive tools in the DrRacket IDE
- ...where most of the proofs are written as calculational / equational proofs.
